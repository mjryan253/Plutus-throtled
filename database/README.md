# Database FAQ

This database is a collection of text files containing all funded Bitcoin addresses downloaded from http://addresses.loyce.club/

The name of the text file is the date when the database was last updated in month_day_year format. The file will be updated every 3-6 months.

### How Many Addresses Does The Database Have?

The database currently holds `43,212,954 Bitcoin addresses`. This is the total number of Bitcoin addresses with a balance that exist in the blockchain at the time of uploading.

### Where are my database files??

Don't worry, the github repo does not contain any of the actual database. Github limits files to 50 MB each for upload, so database was omitted.
